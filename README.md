## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

To install and run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to create and activate a virtual environment using the venv module. A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to install packages without affecting the global Python installation. To create and activate a virtual environment, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to create a virtual environment named env (you can use any name):

  - On Windows: `python -m venv env`
  - On Linux or macOS: `python3 -m venv env`

- Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

  - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
  - On Linux or macOS: `source env/bin/activate`

- You should see (env) at the beginning of the terminal prompt indicating that the virtual environment is active.

- Run the following command to install the required packages into the virtual environment:

  - On Windows, Linux or macOS: 
    ```sh 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  This will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file. You can also install any other packages you need using pip.

## Usage

To use this project, you need to run the main.py script with Python. This script will perform basic API calls, data manipulation, and inserting into SQL Server. To run the script, follow these steps:

- Make sure the virtual environment is active (you should see (env) at the beginning of the terminal prompt).
- Run the following command:

  - On Windows: `python main.py`
  - On Linux or macOS: `python3 main.py`

- The script will print some output to the terminal and insert some data into SQL Server.

Here are some examples of how to use this project:

- To change the API endpoint, edit the api_url variable in main.py.
- To change the SQL Server connection string, edit the conn_str variable in main.py.
- To change the SQL query, edit the sql_query variable in main.py.

## Folder Structure

Here is an example of how your project folder structure might look like:

    my_project
    ├── env
    │   ├── bin
    │   ├── include
    │   ├── lib
    │   └── pyvenv.cfg
    ├── main.py
    ├── README.md
    └── requirements.txt

The env folder contains the virtual environment files. The main.py file contains the main script. The README.md file contains this documentation. The requirements.txt file contains the list of packages required for this project.
